#SYLLABUS 2015: Intro C++
Introduction to C++ using Arduino
We will be covering the profesional practices of programming like version control. The course outline and
materials are available in Github. Each student needs to create and account and clone to their own work area
the course materials. That is where all assignements and challenges will be turned in. A majority of the
coding will take place on https://c9.io. Class discussion will be held in https://gitter.io. This allows us
to do code chat. That way I can talk about code properlly formatted and you the student can send me code
examples that are easy to talk about and read. This chat channel will run the entire course. Additionally, we'll be using the Arduino IDE and the Teensy 3.1 Microcontoller.

Spring 2015

Tues: 1:30pm - 4:30pm

Start: Jan 20, 2015
End: May 5, 2015

Grading Policy:
Everyone starts at 0. Each week counts towards participation. The class is very hands on, learning, and doing
happen mostly in class. So in person participation is a requirement, and not being there reduces points accrued. (70%)

Approximately, every three weeks will be a challenge assignment started in class and take two weeks to resolve. (10%)

Weekly, challenge problems will be done in class. As well as, smaller weekly challenges that are take home. (10%)

There will be a final project at the end of class that demonstrates the application of the knowledge aquired during the class. (10%)
